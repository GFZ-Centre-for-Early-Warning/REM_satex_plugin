description=Streamlined algorithms for pixel based classification of Landsat satellite imagery using OTB.
version=0.1
author=Michael Haas (GFZ)
email=mhaas@gfz-potsdam.de

about=This is a QGIS plugin which streamlines a pixel-based classifiaction of Landsat imagery using the OrfeoToolbox (OTB). Only required inputs are: (1) a directory containing the band raster files of one or more Landsat satellite image, (2) a region of interest as a polygon in a shapefile, and (3) a vector containing a polygon feature set with training/testing information. Optionally a trained SVM model for the libsvm implementation of OTB, as also created by the plugin can be provided instead of (3). Note: The plugin requires QGIS (&gt;=2.8) and an installation of the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB, can be installed via OSGeo4W).
